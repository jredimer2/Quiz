# TestSuitePOC
Description: POC test framework for quiz

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. After downloading from GIT, need to rebuild the project so all dependencies are downloaded from NuGet.

2. To run the test, open command line, go to TripPlannerPOC/bin/Debug , then run RunTests.bat 

3. The test results are in TripPlannerPOC/bin/Debug/MyReport.html. It will contain screenshots during test run.

Note: I left the .gitignore file empty so that all files, inluding packages are uploaded to GIT to make things simpler for the purpose of the POC. 

Note: If you are using a recent version of Visual Studio, the tests should appear in the Test Explorer panel on the left.
